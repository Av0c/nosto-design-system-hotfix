### Our tone of voice is what makes us “us”. It’s the little voice that would be inside Nosto’s head. If it had one. It is used to communicate our brand values, deliver on our brand promise and let our brand personality shine. And that’s important – people like to deal with people, not faceless companies.

Our tone of voice isn’t what we say, but how we say it. It’s the language we use, the way we construct sentences and the personality we communicate.

Our business is personal and so is our tone. We are smart, and that shows, but we aren’t arrogant. And we hate unnecessary jargon.

We’re approachable and witty because we believe business doesn’t have to be boring.
But we are deeply passionate about ecommerce so we don’t take it too lightly. We’re excited about our industry and about helping our customers. Our passion for these things comes across in our writing, which is clear, enjoyable and, above all, valuable.
