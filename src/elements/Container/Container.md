## Container can wrap any content together and offers several padding options

### Usage

#### Padding from all sides

```jsx
<container style="border: gray 1px solid; margin-bottom: 8px;">
  <text-style variation="default">
    Design isn’t just about the look and feel. Design is how it works, and we believe the best way to focus on this is
    to work as close to the end result as possible. That’s why we start all our projects with simple sketches, and
    quickly transition into designing working prototypes in code. This is done by the same designers who started the
    work, which ensures that our original design intent is carried all the way to the end product.
  </text-style>
</container>
```

#### Padding from top and bottom

```jsx
<container style="border: gray 1px solid; margin-bottom: 8px;" paddingDirection="vertical">
  <text-style variation="default">
